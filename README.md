# JiSE: Java in S-Expression

JiSE is Clojure's embedded DSL for making it as easy (or maybe even easier?) to write imperative code than in Java.

## Usage

```clojure
(require '[jise.core :refer [defclass]])

^:public
(defclass C
  ^:public ^int
  (defm sumUpTo [^int n]
    (let [^int sum 0]
      (for [^int i 0, (< i n), (set! i (+ i 1))]
        (set! sum (+ sum i)))
      sum)))

;; you can use C as an ordinary Java class
(def c (C.))
(.sumUpTo c 10) ;=> 45
(.sumUpTo c 100) ;=> 4950
```
