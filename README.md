# JiSE: Java in S-Expression

JiSE is Clojure's embedded DSL for making it as easy (or maybe even easier?) to write imperative code than in Java.

## Usage

```clojure
(require '[jise.core :refer [defclass]])

^:public
(defclass C
  ^:public ^{:tag [[int]]}
  (defm multiplication-table [^int n]
    (let [rows (new [[int]] n)]
      (for [i 0 (< i n) (inc! i)]
        (let [cols (new [int] n)]
          (for [j 0 (< j n) (inc! j)]
            (aset cols j (* (+ i 1) (+ j 1))))
          (aset rows i cols)))
      rows)))

;; you can use C as an ordinary Java class
(def c (C.))
(.multiplication_table c 3)
;=> [[1, 2, 3], [2, 4, 6], [3, 6, 9]]
```
