# JiSE: Java in S-Expression

JiSE is Clojure's embedded DSL for making it as easy (or maybe even easier?) to write imperative code than in Java.

## Usage

```clojure
(require '[jise.core :as jise])

^:public
(jise/defclass C
  ^:public ^boolean
  (defm isPythagorean [^int x, ^int y, ^int z]
    (== (+ (* x x) (* y y))
        (* z z))))

;; you can use C as an ordinary Java class
(def c (C.))
(.isPythagorean c 3 4 5) ;=> true
```
